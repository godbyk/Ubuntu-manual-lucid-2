\section{Using a webcam}

Webcams often come built into laptops and netbooks. Some computers, such as Apple desktops, also have webcams built into the monitors. The rest of the webcams typically use \acronym{USB} connections. To use a \acronym{USB} webcam, plug it into an open \acronym{USB} port in your computer. 

\marginnote{There are quite a few applications which are useful for webcams. \application{Cheese} can capture pictures with your webcam and \application{VLC} media player can capture video streaming from your webcam. You can install these from the Ubuntu Software Center.}
Almost all new webcams are detected by Ubuntu automatically. You can configure webcams for individual applications such as \application{Skype} and \application{Empathy} from the application's setup menu. For webcams which do not work right away with Ubuntu, visit \url{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Webcam} for help.
