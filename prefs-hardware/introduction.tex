\section{Using your devices}

Ubuntu supports a wide range of hardware, and support for new hardware improves with every release. 

\section{Hardware identification}

To identify your hardware you can install the following application: Click \menu{Applications}, scroll down to \menu{Ubuntu Software Center}. When the \window{Ubuntu Software Center} window opens, use the search box in the 
top right and search for the following: ``sysinfo.'' Now select the Application click \button{Install} and enter your password to install the application.

To run the application, choose \menu{Applications\then System Tools\then Sysinfo.} The Sysinfo program will then open a window with information about the hardware that is part of your system.
